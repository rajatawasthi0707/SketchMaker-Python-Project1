# SketchMaker-Python-Project1
It is a python project which converts image to a sketch.

OVERVIEW:

Welcome to the Image to Sketch Conversion project! üñºÔ∏è‚ú® This Python-based project was created with the aim of transforming ordinary images into captivating sketches. Inspired by the World Cup final and showing solidarity with Team India, this project uses the power of Python and OpenCV for image processing magic.

FEATURES:
Python Magic: Leverage the simplicity and effectiveness of Python for image manipulation.
OpenCV Integration: Implement image processing techniques using the OpenCV library for stunning sketch conversions.
World Cup Vibes: Crafted with the excitement and spirit of the World Cup final, allowing you to infuse your support for your favorite teams into creative sketches.

HOW TO USE:

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install the required dependencies using: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the script: python image_to_sketch.py.
Input the path to the image you want to convert.
Enjoy the transformed sketch in the output!

WHY THIS MATTERS:

Creativity Unleashed: Turn mundane photos into artistic sketches, exploring the creative side of image processing.
Learn and Grow: Dive into the code to understand image manipulation techniques and enhance your Python skills.
Code with a Cause: Show your support for teams or causes by creating unique sketches through code.
Acknowledgments:
A special thanks to the Python community for support and resources, and to the OpenCV library for making image processing seamless.

What's Next:
